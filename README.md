# aerofoilnoise
The noise generated by an aircraft is an efficiency and environmental matter for the aerospace industry.  A vital component of the total airframe noise is the airfoil self-noise, which is due to the interaction between an airfoil blade and the turbulence produced in its boundary layer and near wake.  Performance optimization can be applied to understand the behavior of airfoils and make designs with reduced noise.  The self-noise data set used in this example was processed by NASA. It was obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel.  The NASA data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position was the same in all of the experiments.
